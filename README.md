**Life Experience** (1983 - 2017)  

I have travelled extensively both for work and for pleasure something that I am incredibly proud of. It has required an incredible amount of hard work and perseverance as well as the right people believing in me at the right time. Through my experiences I have learned a great deal about, and come to appreciate, the differences in us all. Whether culturally, ethnically, socially or of course individually. Yet, and more powerfully I have learned about that which can bring us together; compassion, a desire to connect, insatiable curiosity and acceptance amongst so much more.
