## About

I have been involved in a range of digital and technological projects that have, over time, inspired me to take a leap and pursue a career in tech. From teaching myself basic html and css via YouTube videos and the fundamentals of both Ruby and Javascript via Codecademy to enrolling at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly selective 12 week coding bootcamp designed to produce work-ready software developers.

I am looking for a role in a progressive and challenging environment within an ambitious company that allows me to continue to develop and grow as a developer. I work best when I am striving towards a mission, vision and values that I can truly believe in and where productivity is strongly linked with both my own goals and that of the company.

__Tech Skills__: Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, DataMapper, Sinatra, Rails, TDD, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Version Control

## Skills

#### Creativity

I have designed, communicated and effectively delivered outdoor education lessons to previously unengaged inner city teenagers. In my last role I was responsible for the creation of all marketing materials, including website and social media platforms, from design to implementation. I love to create and tinker, whether building a workbench, [modding gameboy's](https://twitter.com/halewood_retro/status/688712166480949249), taking photos, [throwing pots](https://twitter.com/halewood_retro/status/722414241068748800) or making music. I am constantly putting my mind and hands to task. I also created a [podcast](https://makersacademy.podbean.com/) documenting my journey through Makers Academy

#### Logical/Analytical Thinker

I enjoy solving problems, it's a key reason why I've decided to become a devloper. Within my last role I was critiquing complex contracts, and taking point on major construction projects that require logistical thinking on an industrial scale. I am a keen chess player ([play me](https://www.chess.com/member/haletothewood)) and constantly look for new challenges to keep mye sharp, such as this

#### Fast, Independent Learner

I embarked on a self-study of CSS, HTML and Javascript whilst in my last role and have previously taught myself to build and manage websites using Wordpress and Visual Composer. The best example of which can be found [here](http://www.resincoatingspecialists.com). I have only been studying Ruby and programming in general since June and am proud of the progress I've made to date.

#### Collaborator
Although an accomplished and proven self-starter, having built my own personal training business, I excel most as part of a team. I have a deep understanding of the importance of the soft-skills such as communication, conflict management, trust and leadership that are required to function as an effective team.

**Life Experience** (1983 - 2017)  

I have travelled extensively both for work and for pleasure something that I am incredibly proud of. It has required an incredible amount of hard work and perseverance as well as the right people believing in me at the right time. Through my experiences I have learned a great deal about, and come to appreciate, the differences in us all. Whether culturally, ethnically, socially or of course individually. Yet, and more powerfully I have learned about that which can bring us together; compassion, a desire to connect, insatiable curiosity and acceptance amongst so much more.
