## David Halewood

I have spent most of my adult years driven to help others become their best self. Whether as a personal trainer, an educator, or manager I have always been passionate about personal and professional development. It is this same drive and desire that leads me to constantly challenge myself and look for opportunities of growth. This is how I now find myself enrolled at the software developer bootcamp Makers Academy, a highly selective 12 week program. Upon completion of the course I will be looking for a junior developer role in a supportive yet challenging environment that allows be to continue to develop best coding practices.
