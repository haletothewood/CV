## David Halewood

I have spent most of my adult years driven to help others become their best self. Whether as a personal trainer, an educator, or manager I have always been passionate about personal and professional development. It is this same drive and desire that leads me to constantly challenge myself and look for opportunities of growth. This is how I now find myself enrolled at the software developer bootcamp Makers Academy, a highly selective 12 week program. Upon completion of the course I will be looking for a junior developer role in a supportive yet challenging environment that allows me to continue to develop best coding practices.

## Skills

#### Management

I am an effective and dedicated manger of people, resources and projects. I have lead teams as small as 3 and as large as 200 yet the importance of a shared vision, individual goals, positive culture, and trust remains the same. It is vital that team members understand what is required of them, and the team, and feel inspired to achieve their best. I have successfully project managed on an industrial scale from tendering to completion in my last role. I also have considerable experience in facilities management.

- People Management; involved in the hiring, training and supervision of hundreds of staff; effective at motivating staff through SMART goals, setting and communicating KPIs and performance appraisals
- Project Management; planning, resource and cost management, implementation, contract completion
- Facility Management; safety audits, COSHH, risk assessments and method statements, plant maintenance, inventory, accreditation compliance 

#### Creativity

I consider myself a highly creative person both personally and professionally. I enjoy the process of bringing projects to life from idea through to creation. I also find that being creative helps me to craft code using best practices that can overcome difficult challenges.

- I have written, communicated and effectively delivered lessons to previously unengaged inner city teenagers
- In my last role I was responsible for the creation of all marketing materials, including website and social media platforms, from design to implementation.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September to December)

- Curious and passionate about code - *I have always held a deep appreciation for technology and coding which stems from my upbringing as the [son and younger brother of developers](https://medium.com/@davidhalewood/why-i-chose-makers-academy-to-learn-to-code-1100c7d3b179). From the moment I used MSDOS to encode a single MP3 to today I have constantly utilised my passion for technology to drive business forward. Although it is only recently I have pursued a career in software development it has been a long time coming.*
- Fast, independent learner - *I embarked on a self-study of CSS, HTML and Javascript whilst in my last role and have previously taught myself to build and manage websites using Wordpress and Visual Composer. The best example of which can be found [here](http://www.resincoatingspecialists.com)*.
- Great collaborator - *Although an accomplished and proven self-starter, having built my own personal training business, I excel most as part of a team. I have a deep understanding of the importance of the soft-skills such as communication, conflict management, trust and leadership that are required to function as an effective team. At Makers I am learning the essential hard-skills needed to collaborate on projects that include:*

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine
